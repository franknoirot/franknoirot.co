Here are some links to things I've found interesting or helpful.

## Early Voting

I made a saved Google map of all the NYC Early Voting locations based on [https://vote.nyc/page/early-voting-information](https://vote.nyc/page/early-voting-information) because I found it hard to tell which location was closest to me. You can visit the map for yourself (where you can save it and such) by visiting [this link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1gk4_-NTc2uBlqs7fYc3jOJDiY3HUDFba&usp=sharing), or you can view it below.

I also created a Google Calendar for the dates and times the polling locations will be open, with notifications enabled for an hour before each event. The calendar can be accessed at [this link](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0?cid=aW9kN2NoZjFyYWMyZHFpOG85MmhudTRob2tAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) or can be viewed below. The calendar is also available in [iCal format](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/iod7chf1rac2dqi8o92hnu4hok%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) if you don't use GMail.
