## Early Voting

I made a saved Google map of all the NYC Early Voting locations based on [https://vote.nyc/page/early-voting-information](https://vote.nyc/page/early-voting-information) because I found it hard to tell which location was closest to me. You can visit the map for yourself (where you can save it and such) by visiting [this link](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1gk4_-NTc2uBlqs7fYc3jOJDiY3HUDFba&usp=sharing), or you can view it below.
