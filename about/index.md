I'm Frank. I was born outside of Akron, Ohio, a small city a bit south of the Great Lakes in the United States. I now live in the Washington Heights neighborhood of New York City. I use he/him pronouns.

My current areas of inquiry include:

## The Web
I work as a UX Designer & Developer at netamorphosis. I really, really love the web. I can't overstate how important I think it is, and not just for communication and commerce, but for government, for art, for the environment; the list goes on. I don't think the web is really in our blood as a society yet. I've spent the last few years diving head-first into how the web works, and I'll probably spend the rest of my life digging into that dirt further. This is an over-broad "area of inquiry", but that is because this is the root from which I am branching out. I am exploring all the following areas through the lens of distributed systems, user interface design, and data privacy.

## Urban Nature
I attended Ohio State for my undergraduate degree, studying City & Regional Planning and writing a little paper on how the environment should be added into metrics that measure equity in cities. I'm very interested in the urban biome, and I'd like to eventually do work on bringing city-dwellers closer to the nature all around them, and capture data on all of that nature right under our noses.

## Tool Design
While at Ohio State I founded a student organization called The Maker Club. 6 years out they're still going strong, and I still belive wholeheartedly that the tools are available today to fundamentally rethink how production happens. I am very interested in designing tools, both physical and digital, that everyday people can use to make other things. On the physical side I have built and donated a 3D Printer, a four-color t-shirt screenprinting press, and a CNC machine. On the virtual side, I've started building small tools that help automate simple web design tasks, with the hope to build more robust tools for more concrete problems in the future.

If you are interested in any of these areas, or are just looking to connect and share ideas with someone in Manhattan or in cyberspace, please feel free to reach out.
